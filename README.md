# CustomerSegmentation


Took dataset of Mall Customers and applied K-Means Clustering Algorithm to find 4-5 groups of customers.

Tools:- 
1) Python
2) Google Colab
3) Dataset of Mall Customers in Microsoft Excel Format
4) Python Libraries:- a) pandas
                      b) numpy
                      c) matplotlib.pyplot
                      d) seaborn
5) K-Means Clustering Algorithm


The project on customer segmentation using K-means clustering aims to group customers based on similarities in their behavior
and attributes. Utilizing K-means, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, the project involves clustering customers
into distinct segments, enabling businesses to understand and target specific customer groups more effectively. By analyzing data
such as purchasing patterns, demographics, or browsing history, the algorithm identifies clusters, allowing for tailored marketing
strategies and personalized approaches to meet the diverse needs of different customer segments. The ultimate goal is to enhance customer
satisfaction, optimize marketing strategies, and improve overall business performance.
